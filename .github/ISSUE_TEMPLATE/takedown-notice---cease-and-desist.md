Dear H&H Publishing, Dr. Weinstein, Dr. Palmer, Dr. Acee, and/or any other representatives issuing this letter,

My sincerest apology for whatever I have done. To issue a takedown notice or a cease and desist letter, please replace this text with the contents of your letter. In your letter, please,

- include what exact laws I have broken, and how I broke them (eg, copyright infringement, and state what copyrighted materials I have illegally used),
- also include a proof of your identity and proof of ownership of the rights you claim.

Once I see the letter and can verify that your claims are valid, I will take down this repository. Do note that it is outside of my abilities to take down other copies of this repository (eg, forks and downloaded copies).

Thanks,
User670
